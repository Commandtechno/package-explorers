# package-explorers

https://commandtechno.com/package-explorers

A collection of explorers for different services data packages in a more understandable and readable format and showing you more information

The goal of this repository is to allow people to understand their data more and be more aware, and understanding of what platforms collect about them along with allowing people who are curious to just see interesting statistics or info

My motivation for making this is my interest in data and privacy and being curious on **big data**
